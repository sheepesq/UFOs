# UFOs #
## Overview of Project ##
- to create a filter system of all the ufo sightings that can be easily used.

## Results ##
- The result of this project is a filtering system that can handle between 1-5 at the same time. This allows the user to get very specific in what they are looking for and the results are seen right away.

## Summary ##
- One downside to this filter is that you are not able to search all of the data at once, you have to set one filter.
- Two recommendations for the future on this is allow the user to compare and contrast information and the other one is allow the user to add their own data to the list!
